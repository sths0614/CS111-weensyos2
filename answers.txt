Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: round-robin


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
		schedos-1: 320*4-3
		schedos-2: 320*4-2
		schedos-3: 320*4-1
		schedos:4: 320*4
		average: 320*4-1.5 = 1278.5ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
		schedos-1: 320 
		schedos-2: 320*2
		schedos-3: 320*3
		schedos-4: 320*4
		average: 320*2.5 = 800ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
		schedos-1: 0
		schedos-2: 1
		schedos-3: 2
		schedos:4: 3
		average: 1.5ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
		schedos-1: 0
		schedos-2: 320
		schedos-3: 320*2
		schedos:4: 320*3
		average: 320*1.5 = 480ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?
	both


Exercise 5:
	The first known interrupt occured during the execution of process 4 because it was not
	able to print out the character '4' successfully, it jumped to '1' after '3'


(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)


Anything else you'd like us to know:



Extra credit exercises:
Exercise 8:
	Done by implementing a new system call that atomically prints a character to the console.
	When the macro SYNC_METHOD is set to 2, this synchronization mechanism is used.
	When it is set to 1, the original one is used.
