Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: round-robin


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
		schedos-1: 320*4-3
		schedos-2: 320*4-2
		schedos-3: 320*4-1
		schedos:4: 320*4
		average: 320*4-1.5 = 1278.5ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
		schedos-1: 320 
		schedos-2: 320*2
		schedos-3: 320*3
		schedos-4: 320*4
		average: 320*2.5 = 800ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
		schedos-1: 0
		schedos-2: 1
		schedos-3: 2
		schedos:4: 3
		average: 1.5ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:
		schedos-1: 0
		schedos-2: 320
		schedos-3: 320*2
		schedos:4: 320*3
		average: 320*1.5 = 480ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?
	I completed both for extra credit.
	Exercise 4a: 
		line 36 in schedos-1.c
		line 66-72 in schedos-app.h
		line 33 in schedos-kern.h
		line 184-185, 255-269 in schedos-kern.c

	Exercise 4b: 
		line 37 in schedos-1.c
		line 74-80 in schedos-app.h
		line 34 in schedos-kern.h
		line 187-189, 270-283 in schedos-kern.c


Exercise 5:
	The first known interrupt occured during the execution of process 4 because it was not
	able to print out the character '4' successfully, it jumped to '1' after '3'


(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)

Extra credit exercises:
Exercise 7:
	line 259-424 in lib.c
	line 62-80 in lib.h
	line 191-196, 80, 128 in schedos-kern.c
	line 38 in schedos-1.c 

	Using Steve Park's implementation of random number generator in the files lib.c and lib.h, implemented a new system call (sys_get_ticket) that
	adds its own pid to the tickets[] array. The array indexes are the ticket numbers. When schedule() is called after each printing, a random ticket number called winner
	is generated and the process that matches tickets[winner] is run.
	When the scheduling_algorithm is set to 4, this lottery scheduling algorithm is used.


Exercise 8:
	line 54-56 in schedos-1.c
	line 187-189 in schedos-kern.c
	line 82-88 in schedos-app.h
	line 19 in schedos.h

	Done by implementing a new system call (sys_print) that atomically prints a character to the console using the interrupt code INT_SYS_USER3
	When the macro SYNC_METHOD is set to 2, this synchronization mechanism is used.
	When it is set to 1, the original one is used.
